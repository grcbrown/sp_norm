# 245B-project/experiments
There are three experimental conditions, which are derived from a Latin-square design. Stimuli consist of lexical triplets, designed to elicit "masculine", "non-masculine", and "neutral" masculinity judgments. Each triplet item is embedded within a written sentence. Sentences are identical for each triplet item. Within a condition, participants are exposed to randomized set of sentences containing a subset of masculine lexical items, a subset of non-masculine lexical items, and a subset of neutral lexical items. 

The code for each condition can be found here.
